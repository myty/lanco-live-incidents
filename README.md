# Lancaster County Live Incidents

The original concept was inspired by an app that is only available on the iOS app store; and was first implemented in React Native and Azure Functions as a backend.  So far the frontend has been ported over as a full featured PWA.  The Azure Functions code will eventually find it's way to this repo.  Both the frontend and backend code are deployed automatically with any new commit to the main branch.

So far it is geared towards the phone form factor:
